# JavaScript Output-Based Interview Questions - Handwritten Notes

Welcome to my repository! This collection features handwritten notes on JavaScript output-based questions that are commonly asked in job interviews. These notes are designed to help you understand how JavaScript code executes and produces output, which is a critical skill for technical interviews.

## Contents

The notes are organized into the following sections:

1. **Basic Concepts**
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Operators
   - Control Structures (if-else, switch-case)
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   
2. **Functions**
   - Function Declarations and Expressions
   - Arrow Functions
   - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
   - Closures and Scope

3. **Objects and Arrays**
   - Object Properties and Methods
   - Array Methods
   - Destructuring
   - Spread and Rest Operators

4. **Advanced Topics**
   - Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)
   - Event Loop and Concurrency Model
   - Error Handling
   - Modules and Imports

5. **Common Patterns and Best Practices**
   - Hoisting
   - Context and `this`
   - Prototypes and Inheritance
   - ES6+ Features

## How to Use

1. **Study the Notes:** Go through each section to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript concepts and their outputs.
2. **Hands-On Coding:** Try writing the code snippets yourself to see the output and deepen your understanding.
